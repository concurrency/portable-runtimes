--* This is a package of the uavs pitch, roll, and yaw(heading) data
DATA TYPE ATTITUDE
  RECORD
    INT pitch: --* The pitch 
    INT roll: --* The roll
    INT heading: --* The yaw

--* This is a package of the uavs pitch and roll data
DATA TYPE IMU.DATA
  RECORD
    INT pitch: --* The pitch
    INT roll: --* The roll
:


--*{ LEVEL.FLIGHT.SENSITIVITY  These values change how reactive the servos are to changes in attitude
VAL INT PITCH.SERVO.MULTIPLIER IS (4):  --* Increases the amount of pitch (elevator) correction that occurs
VAL INT ROLL.SERVO.MULTIPLIER IS (4):  --* Increases the amount of roll (aileron) correction that occurs
--*}


--*{ FILTER.GAIN This tells the filtering process how much to favor the gyros over the accelerometers in calculating the attitude
VAL INT ROLL.FILTER.GAIN IS (92):  --* The Gain for our complementary filtering of roll.  The higher the value the more biased the filter is towards the gyro values
VAL INT PITCH.FILTER.GAIN IS (85):  --* The Gain for our complementary filtering of pitch.  The higher the value the more biased the filter is towards the gyro values
--*}


--*{ SERVO.START.POSITION This sets where the initial servo positions are
VAL INT AILERON.START IS (90):  --* The starting positions of the Aileron surfaces
VAL INT ELEVATOR.START IS (90):  --* The starting positions of the Elevator surfaces
--*}


--*{ ATTITUDE.OFFSET  This adjusts what the angles process outputs from the filtered IMU data.  Use if you are off by a degree or two.
VAL INT OFFSET.PITCH IS (-5):  --* The offsets for the pitch angle
VAL INT OFFSET.ROLL IS (-2):  --* The offsets for the roll angle
--*}


--*{ SERVO.PINS  The pin numbers the control servos are attached to
VAL INT ELEVATOR.SERVO.PIN IS (45):  --* The PWM pin number that the elevator servo is hooked up to
VAL INT AILERON.SERVO.PIN IS (44):  --* The PWM pin number that the aileron servo is hooked up to
--*}


--*{ IMU.PINS Analog in pin numbers for the gyros and accelerometers
VAL INT GYRO.X.PIN IS (A4):  --* The analog in pin that the X axis gyro is hooked up to 
VAL INT GYRO.Y.PIN IS (A5):  --* The analog in pin that the Y axis gyro is hooked up to
VAL INT ACCELEROMETER.X.PIN IS (A0):  --* The analog in pin that the X axis accelerometer is hooked up to
VAL INT ACCELEROMETER.Y.PIN IS (A1):  --* The analog in pin that the Y axis accelerometer is hooked up to
--*}


--*{ NAV.LIGHTS Navigation Light Pins
VAL INT RIGHT.WING.NAV IS (34):  --* The digital pin that the right wing green LED is hooked up to.  
VAL INT LEFT.WING.NAV IS (36):  --* The digital pin that the right wing red LED is hooked up to.
VAL INT RIGHT.WING.STROBE IS (33):  --* The digital pin that the right wing strobe LED is hooked up to.  
VAL INT LEFT.WING.STROBE IS (35):  --* The digital pin that the left wing strobe LED is hooked up to.
VAL INT TAIL.STROBE IS (40):  --* The digital pin that the tail strobe LED's are hooked up to.
--*}


--* Number of readings that av averages
VAL INT NUM.READINGS.TO.AVERAGE IS (10):


--* The buffer size that the gps is read into
VAL INT BUFFER.SIZE IS (80):


--* The serial port the the gps is transmiting to
VAL INT GPS.PORT IS (RX1):


--* The bank angle which the turn proc tries to achieve throughout the entire turn
VAL INT TURN.BANK.ANGLE IS (6):
